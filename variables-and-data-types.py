#  Variables and Data Types

# Understanding Variables
# Think of variables as labelled boxes where you can store information. The label(variable name) helps you find what you stores later.

# Creating and using Variables
message = "Hello, Python!"
age =25
price = 19.99 #float
is_sunny = True #boolean

#Printing Variables  #cls clears the terminal
print (message)
print(age)

# We can also print multiple variables using print
print(message,age,price,is_sunny)

# using variables in calculations
new_age = age + 5
print("In 5 years, you will be", new_age)

# variables can be reassigned
age = 26
print("updated age:", age)
